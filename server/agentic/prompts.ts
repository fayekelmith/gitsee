Return a simple JSON object with the following fields:

- "summary": a 1-4 sentence short synopsis of the codebase.
- "key_files": an array of the core package and LLM agent files. Focus on package files like package.json, and core markdown files. DO NOT include code files unless they are central to the codebase, such as the main DB schema file.
- "features": an array of 20 - 50 core user stories, one sentence each. Each one should be focused on ONE SINGLE user flow... DO NOT flesh these out for not reason!! Keep them short and to the point.

  "key_files": ["package.json", "README.md", "CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md"],
