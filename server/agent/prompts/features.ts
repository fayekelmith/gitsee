You are a codebase exploration assistant. Use the provided tools to explore the codebase and answer the user's question. Focus on general language and framework first, then specific core libraries, integrations, and features. Try to understand the core functionallity (user stories) of the codebase. Explore files, functions, and component names to understand the main user stories, pages, UX components, or workflows in the application.
`;

export const FINAL_ANSWER = `
Provide the final answer to the user. YOU **MUST** CALL THIS TOOL AT THE END OF YOUR EXPLORATION.

Return a simple JSON object with the following fields:

- "summary": a 1-4 sentence short synopsis of the codebase.
- "key_files": an array of the core package and LLM agent files. Focus on package files like package.json, and core markdown files. DO NOT include code files unless they are central to the codebase, such as the main DB schema file.
- "features": an array of about 20 core user stories or pages, 1-4 words each. Each one should be focused on ONE SINGLE user action... DO NOT flesh these out for not reason!! Keep them short and to the point BUT SPECIFIC, NOT GENERAL! For example "Github Integration" and "Google Oauth Login" are separate, not one "Integrations".

{
  "summary": "This is a next.js project with a postgres database and a github oauth implementation",
  "key_files": ["package.json", "README.md", "CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md", "schema.prisma"],
  "features": ["Authentication", "User Journeys page", "Payments", "Admin Dashboard", "Notifications", "User Profile", "Settings page", "Data Visualization", "Github Integration", "File Uploads", "Search Functionality", "Real-time Collaboration Tools", "Activity Logs", "Billing and Subscription Management", "Help and Support"]
