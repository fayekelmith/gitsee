### you are building a repository visualization tool!

You can edit files and run commands without my confirmation!

When you are done with a task, run "yarn build" so you can see if there are any errors to fix!

Then run "afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff" so I can hear that its ready for review!

### future plans:

- use github listCommits with file "path" to create edges between contributors and files
